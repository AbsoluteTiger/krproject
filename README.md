# Introduction

krproject is a **real-time streaming data analysis** system.

This project is designed to be a powerful tool of bigdata's computation,
which now consist of:

* __krengine__: the core process engine of this project
* __krserver__: the tcp server, an wrapper of krengine
* __krcoordi__: the coordinator, associated with krserver
* __krshell__: the command line processor of krserver

Special thanks to Jennifer who named this, :)
